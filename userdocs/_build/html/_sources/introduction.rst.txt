Introduction
============

Stellar occultations are a powerful observational technique for the
determination of sizes and shapes of small bodies in the Solar System
with kilometric accuracy. In addition, an investigation of the neighbourhoods
of the occulting body is also possible and may lead to the discovery and
analysis of rings, jets, satellites, and atmospheres as tenous as a few
nanobars. One of the interesting features of a stellar occultation is that
it does not matter how faint the target object is, it is enough to record
the flux variation from the star it occults as its light is temporarily
blocked by the small body. Therefore, high angular resolution information
can be obtained for the faintest objects if the occultation event involves
a bright enough (V~16.0) star. A crucial step in this process is the prediction
of such an event. With the LSST, tens of thousands of TNOs will be observed and
have their positions given with respect to the Gaia astrometry so that the
number of reliable predictions for a variety of interesting objects will
experience an unprecedented increase. In this context, the python-based library
SORA has been developed. It provides a rigorous python-based library for the
analysis of light curves from stellar occultations. It was then developed Occultin,
a graphical interface for SORA in order to make it more accessible not only to
the occultation community but to those who wish to contribute to and better
understand the analysis of a stellar occultation.
